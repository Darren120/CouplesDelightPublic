## In development Features:
- **Calender:** Tracks important dates such as anniversary, mensturation cycle predictor, etc..
- **Deals:** User orientated advertisment, when couples decide to plan, we show them curated deals for trips, date nights, etc... No more blind advertising and hoping for correctly targetted audience and iOS 14 update friendly since we do not collect ANY data that is not required for core functionlity of the app. Advertiser who partner with us know that we are a couples niche app, thus saving cost yet increase lead interaction since it is willful viewing and consideration of the ads by the users.
- **Games:** Ability to share games with other couples.
- **Map:** Show deals on maps when tracking is enabled.
- **Couples Forum:** We believe couples should be able learn from one another.
